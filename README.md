# WHATSAPP
I developed a WhatsApp clone using Node.js, Express.js, Socket.io, and Passport.js. 
The application incorporates CRUD operations and group chatting functionalities.
Leveraging these technologies, I ensured a seamless user experience, allowing for messaging, group interactions, and robust data management.
The project showcases my proficiency in full-stack development and real-time communication.
